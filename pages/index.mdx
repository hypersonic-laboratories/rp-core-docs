# Introduction


Welcome to the official H.E.L.I.X roleplay framework!

This project aims to provide a framework to allow easy expansion for users to build roleplay servers, with supported economy and item management as well as many more in-depth features. The framework additionally provides an abstraction layer on top of more complex features to give a more seamless user experience, such as a Vehicle Management System or User Interface Management System.

# Installation

<Steps>
### Download the source code

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/hypersonic-laboratories/rp-core.git
```
 
### Set the Gamemode
Set the package name as the gamemode in your servers configuration file.
#### Example

```yaml {29}
    # server configurations
[server]
    # server name
    name =              "HELIX server"
    # server description (max 127 characters)
    description =       ""
    # server logo URL (recommended size: 150x75)
    logo =              ""
    # max players
    max_players =       10
    # leave it blank for no password
    password =          ""
    # server IP. we recommend leaving it 0.0.0.0 for default
    ip =                "0.0.0.0"
    # server port (TCP and UDP forwarding needed)
    port =              7777
    # query port (UDP forwarding needed)
    query_port =        7778
    # announce server in the master server list
    announce =          true
    # server tick rate in milliseconds (dangerous! server will tick at each [tick_rate] ms, affecting both server and client performance. 33 ms means 30 ticks per second and is the default and recommended value)
    tick_rate =         33
    # log Level. (1) normal - (2) debug - (3) verbose
    log_level =         2

# HELIX configurations
[world]
    # game-mode package to load (set the main game-mode package to load - you can load only one 'game-mode' package type at once)
    game_mode =         "pcrp-core"
    # packages script list (leave it blank to load all packages, this is usually useful when you have tons of packages downloaded and only wants to load one or some)
    packages = []
    # asset packs list (this will additionally load the asset packs you define here)
    assets = [

    ]
    # default startup map
    map =               "helix::BlankMap"
    # banned HELIX account IDs
    banned_ids = [

    ]
```
